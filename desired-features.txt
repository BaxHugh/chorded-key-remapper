- Map any sequence of keys to any other sequence of keys (including single key sequences)
- Support key press+release sequences as outputs, .i.e for typing words with chords
- Support limited key press sequences as inputs, i.e. double press a key as an input for a key map

Maybe nice-to-haves:
	Specify order that keys are pressed and released in an ordinary map? Will use first in last out by default
